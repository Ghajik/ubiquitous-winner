            <description><![CDATA[While working as a small supporting actor in a movie, Ki Man Sung has nothing else going for him.
However, that was when ,through mysterious circumstance, the movie set had become reality during filming.
With the sound of the director’s cut, during that short take, he’s not an actor but actually thrown into the events occurring, showing the pain and emotions he faces in that moment.
He can only come back if he creates that perfect take…!
Can he grow to become the greatest actor?]]></description>
