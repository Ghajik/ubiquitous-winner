            <description><![CDATA[I met my divorced wife again after several years. Like Takefumi always says to himself, "She's a stranger now." Even though his ex-wife, Chitose, has become more attractive than ever. One day when he accidentally goes out for a drink with her, and thinks he wants to spend a little more time with her tonight, he discovers a terrible truth. ...My ex-wife now has a child, and it's mine. A great love comedy that begins after a divorce!]]></description>
